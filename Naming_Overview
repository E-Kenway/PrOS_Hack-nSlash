Create new Branch, if you are going to code new things.

If you are going to create new features create a new issue. There you choose a title wich describe you're new feature.
In the description you give a little Overview what the problem is or what you are going to do.
Tip: Make checklists with "- [ ] Bla Bla" so the other developers can see what you want to achieve and what you have achieved yet.
Then add a Label to you're issue which describes your work on a specific section. Like "UI, AI, Level-Design etc" and assign yourself or another developer to it.
After your title you see a number. This is your issuenumber.

When you want to start with your work create a new Branch:

Branchnaming:       Issuenumber_Featurename

Then you can work localy on the files.

If you are finished with your work on a specific task in your feature you can commit.

Commitname:         #IssueNumber. changes
Commitdescription:  Describe your changes

When you are finished with your feature, you can create a pull request.

Pull-Request-Name:  (Label): #IssueNumber. Issuenanme 

After that in github online you can see your new Pull-Request in the Pull-Request Tab. Go to your Pull request and connect it with your issue.
Then at the right side assign a Reviewer to your Pull-Request. After that tell him, if he doesn't saw it directly in his notifications.
The Reviewer can now approve your changes or give you some feedback what you should change ("Changes Requested")
Are all changes approved we can merge your branch into the master branch.
